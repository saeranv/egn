"""
Models naturally ventilated space with internal thermal mass in response to
harmonic variation in T_ext. T_int is function of heat balance between
thermal mass (C m = kg J/kgK), and environment

Should reduce hot
temperature significantly when T_ext >= T_int, if building is thermally
massive.

If internal gains are small, diurnal variations are high.




Assumes:
- internal gains small
- internal walls are adiabatic
- no solar gains
